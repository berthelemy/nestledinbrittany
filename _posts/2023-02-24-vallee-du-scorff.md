If you like forests or rivers there's no better place than the Foret de Pont Callec.

It's a huge area between the towns of Bern√© and Plouay and bounded on the South and East by the beautiful River Scorff.

You'll find an abandoned mediaeval village, ancient watermills, and miles and miles of trails through the peaceful woodland.
