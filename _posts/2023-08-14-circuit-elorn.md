Start at the ancient church and ossuary at Sizun and follow this well-marked trail over to the [Lac du Drennec](https://nestledinbrittany.org.uk/finist%C3%A8re/lac-du-drennec).

Apart from a longish stretch on the route out of Sizun, the route is quite shady, and ideal for dogs, with plenty of places to get a drink.

It's not too strenuous, with no major hills to climb, and plenty of changes in scenery.
