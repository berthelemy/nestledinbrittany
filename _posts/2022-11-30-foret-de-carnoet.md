There's nothing I like better than walking amongst trees, especially in a mixed deciduous forest.

The forest here, between Quimperlé and Clohars-Carnoët, is large enough to get lost in, but small enough so that you never need to panic. Keep walking and you'll find a road.

There are plenty of footpaths, mountain bike (VTT) routes, and even a short trim trail (parcours sportif).

Once you've had your exercise, you could follow it up with a crêpe at the [Abbeye St Maurice]({{ site.url }}/finistere/abbeye-st-maurice), just around the corner.
