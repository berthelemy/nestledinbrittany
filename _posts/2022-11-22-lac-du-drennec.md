We often use the word idyllic to describe places in Brittany. This is one of those cases.

Whether you base yourself at the campsite for a week or two, or just come for the evening, you'll discover a truly peaceful corner of the countryside.

Within a few hundred metres of the car park, there is a top class restaurant and crêperie, a "centre nautique" to hire boats and paddleboards, a sandy beach with a  swimming area, and, of course, the campsite, run by Belinda and Andrew - two of the kindest and friendliest people you'll meet.

Around the lake is a signposted footpath (about 6 miles) and an even longer marked cycle path. Go further afield and you've got the whole of the Monts D'Arrée to explore.
