At the north end of a long, narrow ria leading to the sea is the old port of Pont Aven.

You could walk around the centre of the small town in a matter of minutes. If you did you'd truly lose out on what this place has to offer.

We tend to leave the car at the "Bois d'Amour" car park ([Google map](https://goo.gl/maps/KbJFPPwcvD3H3LVy7)) and walk in along the river. It is as beautiful as it sounds, especially in the spring and summer when the flowers are out.

Follow the signs in and you'll arrive in the centre of town, in the middle of a bustling stretch of shops. They're mostly aimed at tourists, with a mix of art galleries (LOTS of art galleries), boulangeries and clothing boutiques.

Then head down towards the quayside on the west side of the river. If you arrive here on market day, it will be full to bursting with all sorts of traders; their vans parked precariously next to the river.

Don't forget to stop for lunch. There are plenty of places to eat, many with open terraces with river views.

And then, if you're feeling energetic, take a wander down the coastal footpath along the river towards the sea. You could keep going all the way round to Mont St. Michel, but that might take a while...
