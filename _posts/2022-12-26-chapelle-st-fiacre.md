There are hundreds of tiny chapels across Brittany, so why choose this one?

Simply because of the architecture. Most of the chapels are quite plain structures. Chapelle St Fiacre is the exact opposite. It's like the architect was given free reign with his or her imagination. Spires, buttresses, gargoyles, crinkly bits, everything...

Go inside and you'll be amazed at the painted wooden screen which traverses the interior with all sorts of weird and fantastical creatures carved on it.

You can use the chapel as the starting point for many local walks, or even do the full walk of the chapels. This will take you up to [Chapelle Sainte Barbe]({{ site.url }}/morbihan/chapelle-st-barbe-le-faouet) north of [Le Faouët]({{ site.url }}/morbihan/le-faouet).
