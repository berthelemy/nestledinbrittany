Right at the end of the River Laïta, south of Quimperlé, is the small, seaside town (une station balnéaire) of Le Pouldu.

This is our place to go if we want a quick blast of sea air.

Park up opposite the Tourist Information centre and Base Nautique. From there you can walk west along the coast path, with a succession of large, sandy beaches and tiny coves.

Or walk east into town, past the cafés and museum, and turn right down Rue Straed Kerzeleg. Follow your nose east, past dream houses and historic cottages. Eventually you'll reach the old port. To come back, retrace your steps up the hill, take the first left and head onto the coast path. Go west and you'll end up back in the town - but watch out for the old semaphore station en route.
