Hillion is a sleepy little town just north of Yffiniac on the Bay of St Brieuc. Its main claim to fame is a large 15th century colombier built by a nobleman to house pigeons. These birds were reserved for the lord, but the locals were allowed to enter the building to clean it and collect pigeon poo as fertiliser for their crops!

Take one of the roads west out of the town and, very soon, you'll get to what makes this place special.

The Bay of St Brieuc is a vast nature reserve with one of the largest tidal ranges in the world. It's an ideal place to while away a happy afternoon strolling the coast path, watching the huge array of birdlife, discovering the coastal plants and exploring the many small beaches.

Don't forget to bring your binoculars. And your camera too - to try to capture the ever-changing colours of sea and sky.
