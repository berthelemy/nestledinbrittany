Sitting at the end of the ria south of Pont Aven, you'll find the tiny resort hamlet of Kerfany Les Pins.

Aside from being a beautiful spot, the highlight is the beachside restaurant "Auberge de la mer". Classy decor, friendly staff, and the most delicious food. It's a bit pricy, but worth every penny!

After your meal, take a walk along the coast path. It doesn't really matter which way you go - the views will be stunning whichever direction you're heading.
