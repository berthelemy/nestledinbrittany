Drive north from Lorient into the heart of Brittany, and you’ll find Le Faouët perched at the top of a hill, just off the main road to Morlaix.

Park up in the main square. From here, you can either just explore the town, or go further afield and follow one of the many walking or VTT routes signposted around the area. There’s a tourist information office (Office de Tourisme Pays du Roi Morvan - Le Faouët, Gourin, Guemene-sur-Scorff) in the north west corner of the square, where you can pick up maps and plenty of information about the local area.

Next to the car park, you’ll find the impressive mediaeval market hall. It’s still used regularly for events. The popular market is held on the 1st, 3rd and 5th Wednesdays of the month. Though, if you arrive on one of those days be prepared to look for parking a bit further away...

All around the mediaeval market hall, you’ll come across a choice of bars, restaurants, crêperies, cafés, and an award-winning boulangerie.

Even if you’re not into art, you’ll find it’s well worth visiting the Musée du Faouët. The museum is located inside the old convent situated on the south west corner of the main square. They have a regularly changing exhibition of paintings and sculptures, many from local artists - both old and current. The museum shares the building with the Médiathèque and the Ecole de musique du Pays du Roi Morvan & Skol Sonerezh Bro Roue Morvan. I’d recommend living in the area just to be part of the extremely active music community here. At the École, you can learn an instrument, or just join one of the many music groups, including choirs traditional music, classical ensembles, big band and jazz improvisation.

Just a little further out of the town centre, there’s one place you must visit: [Chapelle St Barbe]({{ site.url}}/morbihan/chappelle-st-barbe-le-faouet). Follow the signs from the road heading north from the square, or take the well-marked footpath (down and up a pretty steep hill though). I won’t ruin the surprise, but every time I go there I’m blown away by that first sight of the chapel. You’ll see what I mean… Oh, and there’s a lovely little bar in a restored Taverne right on site. From here, there are plenty of walks down along the river, with places to picnic and paddle. You can even walk to the other chapel in the commune, Chapelle St Fiacre (see photo). Both chapels are open for visitors, with masses of fascinating stories and artefacts inside.
