The abandoned village of Vieux Quimerc'h is your starting point for a varied and interesting 13km walk. From the village you climb to reach a point where you can see the Rade de Brest on one side and the Monts d'Arrée on the other.

You'll come across a number of streams - ideal for a thirsty dog. And there's plenty of shade, especially as you enter into the forest.

The route is well-signposted, and is also in the official book of walks for Finistère.
