If you just go to the ferry port you'll miss out on one of the most picturesque small towns in northern Brittany.

Roscoff is an old fishing port, with a long history of maritime trade. Walk through the narrow streets and, on every turn, you'll find something to remind you of the town's story.

These days the trade is mostly tourists (although there's still a lot of fishing and local vegetables). You'll need to reserve a table in one of the many restaurants to guarantee a place for dinner. But you'll be spoilt for choice.

From here you can even get a ferry across to the tiny Ilse de Batz. By the time you've walked out to the ferry at low tide, you'll feel you could have walked to the island itself.
