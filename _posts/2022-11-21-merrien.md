Merrien is a tiny little pleasure harbour on the ria that drops down from Moelan sur Mer.

Walk down the river to the sea and you'll come across all sorts of interesting sites: an old mill, an oyster fishery (with a shop and restaurant open to the public if you like that sort of thing), second world war fortifications, hidden bays, views along the coast and beautiful forest.

It's a great place to spend an afternoon. I've put a link below to one of the walks we do, but there are so many footpaths around the area that you could easily just explore and see where you end up.
