Looking over the Aulne Valley, just opposite [Chateauneuf-du-Faou](/finistère/chateauneuf-du-faou) is the Domaine de Trévarez. As well as the fantastical pink granite château, there are extensive grounds, rhododendron woods, a hidden pool, and, each year, specially commissioned art works in the former, very grand, stables.

The house is a restoration work in progress. Each room offers a small taste of the vision of the man behind it: the politician James de Kerjégu.

Take a picnic, or eat local food in the café next to the stables.

You could easily spend half a day here, if not more, even with children.

You will need a ticket to enter, except on two days in September when all the French historical sites are free. In 2023, these will be the 16th and 17th September.

If you're going to visit the five main historial sites in Finistère, get hold of a Membership Card (Formules d'Abonnement). It'll save you a lot of money.
