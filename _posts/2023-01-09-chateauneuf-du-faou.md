The town of Chateauneuf-du-Faou is mostly famous for its international jazz festival, held every couple of years and full of workshops and live performances.

But head down the (steep) hill from the church, and you'll find an oasis of peace and quiet, next to the Nantes-Brest canal. At one time, this was a major stopping off point, along the 390km route from the Atlantic Ocean to the River Loire.

The section at Chateauneuf is combined with the River Aulne, which is normally quite calm, but after heavy rains becomes a fast, flowing wide torrent.

From here, you can head west to Chateaulin and on to the huge natural harbour at Brest. Or head east towards the Lac de Guerledan and beyond. Walk, cycle, or even kayak (although the latter is easiest in a westerly direction at this point).
