The 15th century Chappelle Saint-Barbe is in a stunning location on the side of a steep valley near the small town of Le Faouêt.

During the day, the ancient bar on the plateau above the chapel is open for drinks, ice creams and souvenirs.

From the car park on the plateau, there are plenty of walks through the woodland and along the river.
