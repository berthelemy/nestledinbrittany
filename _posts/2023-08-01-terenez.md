From the car park at Térénez, you can easily walk to the end of the peninsula, where you'll find the sailing club and a restaurant. Head north though, and you'll soon be on deserted beaches, looking across the beautiful Bay of Morlaix.

With its myriad islands and expansive views, the bay is an ideal place to explore on foot or by water.
