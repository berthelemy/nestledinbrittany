Erdeven is famous for its alignments of standing stones. Next to the car park, you'll find the first set - an impressive collection of stones. But wander along the "Sentier des megaliths" and you'll find many more hidden in the forest.

You can easily spend an afternoon here. Children can run and explore the forest, on a megalith hunt.
