On the opposite side of the river Blavet estuary from Lorient, you'll find the compact town of Port Louis.

It's a town with centuries of sea-faring history - both trading and military. Explore the narrow streets, perhaps grab something to eat, and then head down to the Citadel. Here you'll find not one, but four museums, covering all aspects of the town's global story.

For those in the know, you might even find the town's beach (the "Grand Plage"). Hint - it's the other side of the wall...
