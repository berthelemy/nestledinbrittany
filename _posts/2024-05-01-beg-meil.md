The resort town of Beg Meil is set back slightly from the coast - allowing the many bays, beaches and creeks to keep their natural look and feel.

The best place to start is at one of the large car parks slightly to the west of the town, near the coast. From here you can head west towards the salt marshes of Mousterlin, or east and around Beg Meil Point. You'll be tempted to stop and explore at every turn. White sand, rock pools, clear water - it's everything you need to relax.

The 7.4km walk listed on this page takes you past the coast guard station (No photos!), around the point, and along a cliff-top path tight between huge gardens and tiny coves.

Drop into town when you reach the harbour. Here there are plenty of places to eat and drink. From the harbour, you can also pick up a boat trip out to the Isles de Glénan (a paradise for sailors) or across the bay to [Concarneau](https://nestledinbrittany.org.uk/finist%C3%A8re/concarneau).
