            <p>Welcome to our house in France! It's an old Breton farmhouse dating from the 18th Century, with thick granite walls, oak beams, and many other original features.
</p>
<p>Set in the small, rural hamlet of Bourgeal, the house is only 3 miles from the nearest market town and 45 minutes from the coast. It's well placed for anyone seeking peace and quiet, or a more active, outdoors-type holiday.
</p>


<p>The house faces south and looks out over our small front garden and the hamlet. At the rear, there's a lovely set of old, stone steps leading up to the first floor from our larger back garden.
</p>

<p>Indoors, we've retained as many of the original features as possible. These, combined with vintage and handmade furniture and accessories, lend a homely, simple feel to the place. We've also introduced some modern home comforts to make your stay a pleasant one.
